# Java Game

My game for my computer science class culminating project.

## Number Slider

Made with `Java` and `Swing`

Based off of the popular logic puzzle:
Example seen [here](https://www.artbylogic.com/puzzles/numSlider/numberShuffle.htm)

:star: The goal of the game is to slide all the numbers into ascending order.

## How to run

- Ensure `java` is installed
- Inside the project directory, run `$ java -cp bin App`
